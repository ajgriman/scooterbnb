# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end
# db/seeds.rb
require "open-uri"

# 1. Wipe existing data
Booking.delete_all
Vehicle.delete_all
User.delete_all

# 2. Create users
owner = User.create!(
  email:    "owner@scooterbnb.com",
  password: "password",
  name:     "Owner Alice"
)

renter = User.create!(
  email:    "renter@scooterbnb.com",
  password: "password",
  name:     "Renter Bob"
)

# 3. Sample image URLs (swap with real URLs later)

# 4. Seed ownerâ€™s vehicles

# Booking 1: valid booking on first vehicle
